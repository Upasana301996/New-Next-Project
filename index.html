              NEXT is a learning platform for Humber students to collaborate
              across programs, work directly with clients, and learn how to
              manage and market an agency. Here at NEXT, we value education,
              innovation, and the ability to think big. We know incredible work
              is being done by our students, so we want to showcase their
              talents while offering them real world experience. The next
              generation of creatives is here.<br /><br /><br />Building F is an
              initiative from the Faculty of Media and Creative Arts at Humber
              College, formerly known as The Ad centre, that has been running
              since 2016. The idea behind the program is to invite external
              organizations that have a creative challenge or project in the
              fields of marketing, advertising, publics relations, digital
              communications, and or design, to work with our students.
              Depending on the needs of the client, we connect them to the
              appropriate program and respective professors to bring the work
              into the classroom through a related assignment.  The aim is to
              create a more timely, relevant, and powerful educational
              experience, by giving students real work experience that they can
              leverage towards their chosen career.<br /><br /><br />NEXT is a
              learning platform for Humber students to collaborate across
              programs, work directly with clients, and learn how to manage and

              To expand the program, whereas to create a student run agency that
              emulates a real agency and overseas the operations of the program.
              Students would be chosen from all related programs through an
              application process and work voluntarily 1 hour a week on projects
              and gain mentorship and guidance from an industry board and or
              faculty. The work would revolve around marketing, operations,
              client relations, and communications. In adding this new platform
              for students, we aim to give these students a competitive
              advantage by providing relevant agency experience and an
              environment to apply their learnings in a collaborative setting.
